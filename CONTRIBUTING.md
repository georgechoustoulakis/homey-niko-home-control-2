# Contributing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 (same as CI)
- Homey CLI: `npm i -g homey`, then `homey login`
- A Homey Pro and a Niko installation with a Hobby API token, for running the app

## Development loop

```sh
npm ci
npm run lint:fix
npx tsc --noEmit
homey app validate --level verified  # same check as CI
homey app install                    # installs over the store version, keeps devices and Flows
```

Avoid `homey app run` on a Homey with real devices: quitting it uninstalls the app, which removes
all paired devices and their Flows. Roll back by updating from the App Store.

Architecture, data flow and rules: see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Adding a Niko device type

1. Dump the real device: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in your controller, then
   `npm run niko:dump -- --type <type> --watch 60 --sanitize`. Compare with the Hobby API
   documentation, which is not always complete.
2. In `src/niko/NikoTypes.ts`: add the model/properties to `NikoModel`/`NikoProperty` and a typed
   `XxxMqttDevice` interface.
3. Add `drivers/<id>/`:
   - `driver.compose.json` and assets (`icon.svg`, `images/{small,large,xlarge}.png`)
   - `driver.ts`: extends `NikoDriver`, lists the supported models
   - `device.ts`: extends `NikoDevice<XxxMqttDevice>`, implements `updateStatus()` and ends
     `onInit()` with `syncWithController()`
4. Translate every new string to en, nl, fr, da and sv (see AGENTS.md).
5. Run `homey app validate` and commit the regenerated `app.json`.

## Compatibility

- Driver IDs and folder names are permanent: paired devices are bound to them.
- The device store must stay readable by new versions (see AGENTS.md).
- Expected states such as an offline controller mark devices unavailable; never throw for them.

## Pull requests

- `npm run lint:check` and `homey app validate` pass (CI runs both).
- Tested with `homey app install` on a real installation; mention which devices.
- No tokens or installation data (names, UUIDs) in code, logs or screenshots.

## Releasing (maintainer)

Two manual workflows, as in Athom's templates (`homey app add-github-workflows`):

1. **Update Homey App Version**: pick the version bump and enter the changelog. It commits the
   version, tags it and creates a GitHub release.
2. **Publish Homey App**: builds the current `main` and uploads it to Homey. Finish the submission
   (test or live) via the link in the job summary.
