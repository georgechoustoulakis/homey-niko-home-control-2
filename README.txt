This app connects your Niko Home Control 2 system to Homey using the local Hobby API and JWT authentication. Devices such as lights and dimmers can be controlled directly from Homey flows.

Installation is simple: add your Niko Home Control 2 controller, authorize with your JWT, and Homey will discover compatible devices on your network. The integration works locally for faster response and reliable operation.
